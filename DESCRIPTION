Description: This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set
        Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in
        (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene
        Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a
        faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene
        expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations
        using the Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et
        al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply
        evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single
        number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a
        complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P
        values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted.
        Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g.,
        pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining
        statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible
        with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g.,
        LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to
        improve specificity. For questions, contact Chris Bolen
